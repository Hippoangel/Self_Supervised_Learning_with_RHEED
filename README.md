# Self_Supervised_Learning_with_RHEEDCancel changes

## What is RHEED
 RHEED(Reflection High Energy Electrion Diffraction) is one of methodology to  characterize the surface of crystalline materials. RHEED shot the electron beam by its special gun to surface of materials, which makes reflected electrons. These reflected electrons collides with detector and it makes unique pattern depend on the matterials. 

 The patterns have been analysized by numerous of ML like PCA, really classical method to classify the matterial's pattern and understand its property. And we adopted the art-of-state method Self-Supervised Learning method proposed by Google and Meta

## What is Self-Supervised Learning?

The CNN was a revolution to computer viseion area. But it has really critical problem. Too expensive to create proper dataset and its labeling despite a real laboratory doesn't have enough money to classify the data. Because it spend so much time of poor graduate student Google and Meta proposed the algorithms for computer to understand the difference of images and calculate its loss to classify the images by computer even labels for data is not required.

These algorithms was crucial to diagnose the COVID-19. Unlikely the time of graduate student is cheap, time of Doctors are expensive to label thousands X-ray picture. Similary the time of physist is priceless, we made accepted this algorithms for RHEED.

Firstly, we used the medical papers to accept our RHEED data and then tried to ours.
